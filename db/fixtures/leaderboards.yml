franchises:
  rankable_type: Shop

strongest:
  rankable_type: Pet
  name: Strongest Fighters
  description: The strongest fighters are pets who have the most wins over the most fights. Winning means little if you've only proven yourself against a handful of opponents, and so a pet's victories become more meaningful over more battles. Ranking leaders are not grouped by level or opponent difficulty, and so the rank represents the total factors contributing to a pet's recent battle record.
